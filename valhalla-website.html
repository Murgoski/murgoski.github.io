            <h3>Fully Working Website For a Hair Salon</h3>
            <p>
                Valhalla is a website for a hair salon that I developed as my final high school project. 
                It provides many functionalities for a modern hair salon website, such as system for ordering customers, 
                a sign-up and log-in system, viewing ordered customers system and a system for adding new services or deleting existing ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website comprises four primary pages designed to provide visitors with comprehensive information about the salon's offerings and streamline their interaction with the services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <li><span>About Us: </span>This page serves as an introduction to the salon. It features staff profiles, general salon information, opening hours, location, and contact details.</li>
                <li><span>Services: </span>Dedicated to showcasing the salon's offerings, this page presents services in visually appealing "cards." Each card includes an image, title, detailed description, and price.</li>
                <li><span>Order: </span>Visitors encounter a user-friendly form on this page, designed to collect essential customer information for seamless service orders, ensuring a smooth transaction process.</li>
                <li><span>Log in: </span>An exclusive access point for registered salon employees. Using their credentials, staff can securely access the system, enabling efficient management of customer interactions and appointments.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                In developing this website, I've employed a set of technologies to enhance its functionality and interactivity. 
                While HTML and CSS provide the fundamental structure and visual aesthetics, the integration of PHP and MySQL programming languages brings advanced capabilities to the table.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PHP handles user inputs, processes data, and dynamically generates pages based on specific requests.</br>
                MySQL securely stores and retrieves the necessary data to support the website's functionalities. 
            </p>
