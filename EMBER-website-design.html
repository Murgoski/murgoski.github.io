          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            EMBER is a fictional restaurant website concept created entirely by me — from the name, brand idea, and overall visual identity to the complete website design.
            The goal was to design a modern and elegant web experience that combines warm tones, minimalist typography, and smooth visual flow to evoke the feeling of a premium dining atmosphere.
            The project includes desktop and mobile versions, carefully adapted for responsive behavior and optimal usability across devices.

          <h2>Things I Have Learnt</h2>
          <p>Working on this project helped me grow creatively and technically.
              It was also <b>my first website design</b> made with the open-source tool <b>Penpot</b>, that helped me understand the workflow between UI design and front-end development.
          </p></br>

          <p>Through this project, I learned to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create consistent visual systems and reusable design components.</li>
            <li>Build responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile.</li>
            <li>Apply principles of alignment, spacing, and color contrast.</li>
            <li>Focus on usability and user flow.</li>
            <li>Better understand how fonts and color choices shape the overall look and feel.</li>
          </ul>
