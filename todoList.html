                        <h2>Task additional information</h2>
                        <p>The Clipboard button, when clicked, opens a popup window with additional information about a certain task.
                            The task description in the individual task closely resembles the information provided in the task description popup.</br>
                            The main difference lies in the additional details featured in the popup, such as the <strong>start date</strong> and a more <strong>detailed description</strong>, 
                            which enriches the understanding of the task's specifics.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Feedback form</h2>
                        <p>The form pops up when the user clicks on the <strong>Feedback button.</strong></p>
                        <p>It enables users to send feedback to the admin for upgrades and improvements.</p>
                        <p>The form features three fields:</p>
                        <ul class = "list">
                            <li><strong>Full Name</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Email Address</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback Textarea</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This feature helps in gathering user suggestions and identifying areas for enhancement.</p>
